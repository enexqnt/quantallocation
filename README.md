2. [Residual Income Model and Abnormal returns](https://github.com/enexqnt/quantallocation/blob/main/Residual%20Income%20Model%20and%20abnormal%20returns-checkpoint.ipynb) - Empirical Backtesting
3. Vanilla Mean Variance Optimization and in-sample backtesting using riskfolio-lib
4. Mean Variance, Black & Litterman, Pure Bayesian and Jorion Rule for in-sample optimization using PyPortfolioOpt
5. Regime Based Asset Allocation with Gaussian Mixture & Risk Parity (Work in progress)
